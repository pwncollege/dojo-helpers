# pwn.college dojo helpers

Some local scripts to help students interact with the dojo remotely.

Current scripts:

- **forward**: forwards various types of connections (TCP, UDP, UNIX, SOCKS) between the dojo and your local machine. Can be used to get proxied internet access on the dojo!
- **backup**: handles backing up and restoring your dojo home directory. Use this often!
- **highlight**: highlights specific words in .md files (by wrapping them with a character of your choice).
